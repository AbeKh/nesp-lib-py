# NESP-Lib â€“ New Era Syringe Pump Library for Python

This project aims to offer a clean high-level interface to the New Era syringe pumps by New Era Pump
Systems.

These pumps are also distributed under different names, like Aladdin by World Precision Instruments
(WPI) and LA by Landgraf Laborsysteme.

## Examples

### Configuring

``` python
from nesp_lib import Port, Pump, PumpingDirection

# Constructs the port to which the module is connected.
port = Port('COM1')
# Constructs the pump connected to the port with pump identity 1000 (NE-1000).
pump = Pump(port, 1000)
# Sets the syringe diameter of the pump in units of millimeters.
pump.syringe_diameter = 30.0
# Sets the pumping direction of the pump.
pump.pumping_direction = PumpingDirection.INFUSE
# Sets the pumping volume of the pump in units of milliliters.
pump.pumping_volume = 1.0
# Sets the pumping rate of the pump in units of milliliters per minute.
pump.pumping_rate = 20.0
```

### Running (Blocking)

Blocking running waits while the pump is running.

``` python
# Runs the pump considering the direction, volume, and rate set.
pump.run()
```

### Running (Non-blocking)

Non-blocking running returns immediately after starting the running.

``` python
# Starts running the pump considering the direction, volume, and rate set.
pump.run(False)
# Waits while the pump is running.
pump.wait_while_running()
# Starts running the pump considering the direction, volume, and rate set.
pump.run(False)
# Waits while the pump is running.
while pump.running :
    # ...
# Starts running the pump considering the direction, volume, and rate set.
pump.run(False)
# ...
# Stops the pump.
pump.stop()
```
